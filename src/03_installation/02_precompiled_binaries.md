# Pre-compiled Binaries

The recommended way to install Hyperbase using pre-compiled binaries is to utilize Docker. You can visit [the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) for instructions on how to install and use Docker.

Hyperbase image can be found at [this link](https://hub.docker.com/r/mnaufalhilmym/hyperbase).

If needed, you can also use Hyperbase UI image from [this link](https://hub.docker.com/r/mnaufalhilmym/hyperbase-ui).

You can pull the image using this command:

```console
$ docker pull mnaufalhilmym/hyperbase
$ # docker pull mnaufalhilmym/hyperbase-ui
```

After pulling the image, you can proceed to [setup](04_setup/01_chapter.md).
