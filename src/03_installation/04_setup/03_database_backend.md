# Database Backend

You can choose one of PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or any other database compatible with any of the three. Note that we only tested PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite so we recommend choosing one of them especially for production environment. Don't forget to configure a secure username, password, and database name. Also make sure the connection exposed by the database is secure.

We recommend using Docker to install the database.
